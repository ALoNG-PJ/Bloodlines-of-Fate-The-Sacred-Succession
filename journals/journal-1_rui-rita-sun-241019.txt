Week 7
Hey team,
I wanted to take some time to reflect on how we’ve been doing with Bloodlines of Fate: The Sacred Succession so far. Honestly, I think we’ve made some great progress since the professor gave us their feedback, even though it was a bit overwhelming at first. It’s clear that addressing those points has really helped us focus on what matters most in the game, and I’m feeling more confident about where we’re heading.
Feedback and Adjustments
1. Making the Concept Clearer
One of the big things the professor mentioned was that our concept felt scattered and like it didn’t all fit together. To fix this, we went back to the basics and really focused on tying the story, characters, and gameplay mechanics to the main theme of power, equality, and self-awareness. For example, we simplified some of the character arcs and made sure that every decision and event in the game reflects those core ideas. It feels a lot more cohesive now, and I think players will really get what we’re going for.
2. Scaling It Down
The scope of the game was definitely too big at first. We had so many characters, locations, and endings planned, and it wasn’t realistic to finish all of that in the time we have. By cutting the player characters down to three and limiting the locations to Village, Swamp, and Inn, we’ve been able to focus on making those parts of the game really strong. It’s still going to be an awesome experience, but now it’s actually doable.
3. Fixing the Timeline
The updated deadline for the showcase threw us off for a bit, but I think we’ve adjusted well. We reorganized our timeline to prioritize playtesting and polishing the demo earlier, and it’s been great to have more structure in how we approach each week. I feel like we’re on track now, and it’s nice knowing we’ve built in time for feedback and revisions.
What’s Been Challenging
Honestly, one of the hardest parts for me has been simplifying the mechanics without losing what makes the game exciting. At first, the voting system we had felt way too complicated, and it just wasn’t working the way we hoped. It took a lot of trial and error—and some pretty long discussions—but we finally found a way to streamline it. Now, every decision feels like it really matters, and I think it fits the story much better. It wasn’t easy getting there, though.
Another challenge has been juggling all the moving parts, like the scripts, cards, and visuals. There’s just so much to do, and it can feel overwhelming at times. What’s helped the most is breaking everything into smaller tasks and making sure we’re all on the same page during our weekly meetings. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely helped me feel less stressed and more in control of my part.
What’s Going Well
I’m really proud of how we’ve been working together. Everyone has been so on top of their tasks, and it’s awesome seeing the game start to come together. The scripts are looking great, the visuals are coming along, and I love how the locations are shaping up. Plus, I think we’ve done a great job of balancing workloads and making sure no one feels overwhelmed (or too chill!).
What’s Next
Looking ahead, I think playtesting is going to be key. We need to make sure everything flows smoothly and that the choices actually feel meaningful. I also think we should finalize the visuals soon so we can focus on the little details in the last stretch. If we can keep up the momentum, I know we’ll have something we can all be proud of at the showcase.
Thanks for all the hard work so far. I know it’s been a lot, but we’re getting there. Let’s keep pushing and make Bloodlines of Fate as awesome as we know it can be!
Best Wishes,
