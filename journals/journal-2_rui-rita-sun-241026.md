### **Week 8: Process Journal Entry**

Hello team,

I wanted to take a minute to reflect on where we’re at and share some thoughts about how things are going. I think we’ve made a lot of progress this week, and it’s starting to feel like our game is really coming together. There’s still plenty to do, but I’m feeling optimistic about what we’ve accomplished so far.

#### **Progress So Far**

This week, we spent a lot of time refining the gameplay mechanics, and I think it’s paying off. The decision-making system is much smoother now, and it feels more connected to the themes we’ve been working with—power, equality, and self-awareness. Simplifying some of the voting mechanics has made the game flow better, and I think it’s going to feel more engaging for players.

I’m also really happy with the placeholder materials we’ve started using, like the character sheets and cards. Even though they’re just drafts, it’s so helpful to have something physical to work with. Seeing the pieces start to take shape has been super motivating.

#### **Challenges**

One thing I’ve been worried about is the pacing of the game. Because there are so many stages: exploration, decision-making, discussions. I’m concerned it might feel a bit slow or overwhelming at times. We’ve talked about simplifying some of the decision points, but I think the real test will come when we playtest it. That’s going to be the best way to figure out what works and what doesn’t.

Another thing we need to work on is balancing the freedom players have with keeping the story on track. I think adding those narrative checkpoints we talked about will help a lot. They’ll give players freedom to explore and make choices, while still making sure the story doesn’t lose its focus.

Lastly, I think we need to spend a bit more time on the details of the character motivations. The main arcs are really strong, but there are a few places where the connections between the characters and the story could be clearer. Maybe in our next meeting, we can set aside some time to go through each character and make sure everything lines up.

#### **What’s Going Well**

One of the things I’ve really appreciated this week is how well we’ve been working together as a team. Everyone’s been so creative and supportive, and it feels like we’re all on the same page about what we want this game to be. I’ve especially loved seeing how much thought has gone into world-building. And it is one of the strongest parts of the project, and it’s thanks to everyone’s contributions.

Our weekly meetings have been super helpful for staying organized and on track. I think breaking everything into smaller tasks has made a big difference, and it’s great to see how much progress we’re making each week.

#### **Next Steps**

Moving forward, I think our top priority needs to be getting a playable prototype together. Even if it’s rough, we need to test it to see how the mechanics and pacing feel in action. I also think we should start thinking about the showcase: what materials we’ll need and how we want to present the game to really highlight its best features.

I’d also like to spend some time polishing the placeholder materials, like the character sheets and cards, to make sure they’re as clear and useful as possible. It’s a small thing, but I think it’ll go a long way toward making the game feel more cohesive.

#### **Final Thoughts**

I’m really proud of what we’ve done so far, and I think we’re in a good place heading into the final stretch. We’ve put so much thought and effort into this project, and I think it’s going to pay off. Let’s keep the momentum going and make sure we’re ready to show everyone what we’ve been working on.

Thanks for all your hard work\!
