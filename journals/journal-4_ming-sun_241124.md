Week 10 Journal


Hello teams,
 
Our final project is now complete, and I’d like to take this chance to share our overall progress and some reflections. From the initial vague ideas to the finished product, this journey has been full of challenges and accomplishments. Seeing our hard work come together so beautifully makes me feel truly proud.  


Project Reflection and Progress Review

During this week, our team has made significant progress in developing the game project, especially in refining the design documents and game flow. I reviewed all the game-related documents uploaded by PJ and raised some key questions, such as whether it was necessary to keep the example endings in the “Ending Chart” and whether the content needed further simplification to improve readability. After discussing these issues with PJ, we addressed each concern and clarified the direction for adjusting the documents.

During the modification process, I adjusted the font of the document to make it more suitable for players to read. At the same time, in order to optimize the user experience of the game, I added some comments to promote the game process. Although these changes are detailed, they greatly improve the clarity and functionality of the document. In terms of structural adjustment, I merged the two documents Endings and Ending Chart to reduce the amount of information players get and make them clearer about the game process. And created a folder for submitting the final version of the game to ensure that all content is in order. This integration not only facilitates the collaboration of team members, but also improves the overall efficiency of the project.

Meanwhile, team member Rita redesigned the character portraits, and her efforts added great visual appeal to the game. To further improve the game resources, I designed a separate cover for each character manual, which included adding the game name and character name. I chose different text effects and layouts based on the image of each character. Although this task required combining the theme of the game with the characteristics of the characters, the final result was highly recognized by the team.


Smooth Progress

Many aspects of the project have progressed smoothly and are worth celebrating. First, our team collaboration has been highly efficient, with each member completing their tasks on time and contributing to our shared goals. Both the refinement of the documentation and the improvements in visual design were completed in an organized manner within the planned schedule. Additionally, we have gradually clarified the structure in the game design documents, linking all materials together to present them cohesively to players. This week, I printed and bound all the game content, ensuring that our final game design was completed successfully and on time.


Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the process, I faced a few challenges. Designing the character handbook covers and reformatting the documents were the two most difficult tasks for me. Creating the covers required finding a visual style that matched the game within a limited time frame.This requires repeated adjustments and attempts, but the final result proves that the effort is worth it. The reformatting of the document requires dealing with a lot of details, including fonts, paragraph structure, and content logic. Although this work is tedious, I successfully completed the goal through my patience and the collaboration of other team members.

In addition, when discussing issues in the document with PJ, we occasionally had disputes due to different ideas. However, through rational communication and grasp of the overall goals of the project, these differences were eventually resolved well. This made me deeply realize the importance of communication in teamwork.


Feelings about the overall status of the project

So far, the overall status of the game project is satisfactory. The quality of documentation has improved significantly, the visual design has been refined, and the team's execution is extremely efficient. The smooth progress of the project makes me confident in the future results, and I am even more looking forward to the final feedback from players.

Overall, this week's tasks not only allowed me to improve my skills in document editing and visual design, but also taught me to stay focused under pressure and complete tasks efficiently. I believe that our game projects can reach a very high level and bring players a truly unforgettable experience.

Our work is coming to an end, and Rita and I will record the game video next week. Thank you to every member of the team for their hard work!
