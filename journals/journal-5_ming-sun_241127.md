Week 11 Journal  


Hello team,  

This week marked another significant milestone for our game project, as we worked on finalizing the gameplay video and preparing for the showcase. Seeing everything come together has been truly rewarding, and I’m excited to share our progress and reflections. It’s incredible to witness how far we’ve come, transforming our initial ideas into a polished, fully functional project ready for presentation.  


Project Reflection and Progress Review

Over the past week, I wrote the script for the gameplay flow and the voice-over lines required for the game video. These scripts were essential to clearly explain the game's mechanics and story, ensuring that the video would be both informative and engaging for viewers. Once the content was finalized, I printed and organized all the materials, making the recording process more efficient and streamlined.  

To thoroughly test the game and capture authentic gameplay footage, I invited five friends to playtest the game. I guided them through the rules and setup, helping them understand the objectives and flow of the game. During their playthrough, I recorded their interactions and decisions, capturing key moments to showcase the gameplay dynamics. Afterward, I edited the footage into a captivating gameplay video. Once the video was complete, I uploaded it to Google Drive and shared the link on GitHub for easy access by the team and collaborators.  

In preparation for the showcase, I worked closely with Rita to create a PowerPoint presentation. I was responsible for the layout and visual design, ensuring that the slides were clear, cohesive, and visually appealing. This included organizing the information, choosing appropriate fonts and colors, and maintaining a consistent design throughout. Meanwhile, Rita focused on adding detailed content about the game, including its background, characters, and specific gameplay steps. She also integrated screenshots from the gameplay video into the slides, providing a step-by-step visual representation of the game process. Together, we ensured the presentation would effectively communicate our game’s key features and mechanics.  


Challenges

One significant challenge was time management. Balancing the tasks of writing the script, recording and editing the gameplay video, and working on the PowerPoint presentation required careful planning and prioritization. Completing everything on time while maintaining quality was not easy but necessary to meet our goals.

Another challenge was the video recording and editing process. Coordinating schedules with the friends who tested the game and ensuring the recording captured the entire gameplay process smoothly required significant effort. During editing, selecting the most engaging moments to create a concise and compelling video was time-consuming and required attention to detail.

Lastly, the design and beautification of the PowerPoint presentation also presented some difficulties. Creating a visually appealing layout that was both engaging and easy to follow required several iterations. Balancing the aesthetic appeal with clarity under tight time constraints was particularly challenging.


Feelings about the overall status of the project

With the gameplay content, video, and presentation completed, our project is fully prepared for Thursday’s showcase. This week’s progress represents the culmination of our hard work, and I am excited to see how it will be received.

Reflecting on the journey, I feel incredibly proud of what our team has achieved. From conceptualizing the game to finalizing its design and presentation, it has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience. Our collaboration as a team has been excellent, with each member playing an integral role in creating a unique and cohesive project.

I am particularly looking forward to the showcase and the feedback we will receive. I believe our game will leave a strong impression and stand out during the presentation.

Thank you to everyone for your hard work and dedication. Let’s give it our all and make Thursday’s showcase a success!
